# RPNCalculator
sample RPN calculator exercise


##Questions

How would you implement an infix notation calculator, i.e. ordinary arithmetic expressions such as 1+2, on top of your RPN calculator?

This would be implemented using a queue, instead of stack. 

How would you deploy your calculator as a service in a cloud environment?

As this is a lightwight application, I would get an AWS EC2 instance in order to deploy it.
